# What is this?

A mod that allows all players to talk to players in their proximity.

# Who can talk?

Anyone, even spectators, dead players, and commanders.
Although commanders are quite hard to hear, so you shouldn't expect marines to hear you.

# Who can hear me?

Depends on which mode you use, there's two key binds after all.
One allows everyone to hear you, the other is only for your own team.

# How do I use this?

As noted above, there are two key binds.
You must manually set either or both of these key binds.

The key bindings are prefixed with "Proximity Communication" and are
at the very bottom, so you have to scroll quite a lot!

# Compared to competitors

Compared to competitors this mod is more compatible with other mods,
future releases of NS2.

One big problem of the competitors is that they will break any other mod
or update to NS2 that adds a key bind. This is quite undesirable, so
you might want to use this.
